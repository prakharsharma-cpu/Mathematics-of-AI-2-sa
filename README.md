📊 AI-Powered Sports Insights Dashboard
Player Injuries and Team Performance
🚀 Project Overview
This project examines the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Sports Analytics by analyzing how football player injuries impact team performance, win-loss ratios, and individual recovery. Built using Python, Streamlit, and Plotly, the dashboard provides actionable insights for coaches, analysts, and technical directors.
🎯 Purpose & Rationale
- Career Relevance: Develops expertise in sports analytics and performance optimization.
- AI Alignment: Applies data preparation, statistical reasoning, and AI-driven insights for real-world decision-making.
- Employability Skills: Enhances coding, critical thinking, and communication of data-backed insights.
🎓 Intended Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, learners will:
- Process and clean injury datasets using pandas
- Visualize insights with Plotly and Streamlit
- Apply mathematical/statistical reasoning to assess injury impact
- Deploy dashboards on Streamlit Cloud with GitHub integration
- Present professional reports and interactive solutions
🏢 Project Context
As a Junior Sports Data Analyst at FootLens Analytics, you are tasked with building an interactive dashboard using multi-season football injury and performance data.
📌 Objective
Create a dashboard that visualizes the relationship between player injuries, team standings, and individual performance.
💡 Impact
- Helps managers make data-driven squad rotation decisions
- Assists technical directors in evaluating recovery patterns
- Identifies players and clubs most affected by injuries
🧪 Methodology & Stages
Stage 1: Data Collection & Cleaning
- Load datasets using pandas
- Handle missing values in ratings, goals, and injury dates
- Convert injury dates to datetime format
- Engineer metrics:
- Average player rating before/after injury
- Team performance drop index during absence
Stage 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify frequently injured players
- Detect clubs impacted by injury clusters
- Compare win/loss ratios during absences
- Analyze post-injury recovery trends
Stage 3: Visualization Design
- Bar Chart: Top 10 injuries causing performance drop
- Line Chart: Player performance before vs after injury
- Heatmap: Monthly and club-level injury frequency
- Scatter Plot: Player age vs performance drop index
- Leaderboard Table: Top comeback players
Stage 4: Dashboard Development
- Build Streamlit dashboard with filters (player, club, season)
- Display KPIs: win/loss impact, recovery index, comeback score
- Ensure an interactive and user-friendly interface
Stage 5: Deployment
- Upload project to GitHub with app.py and requirements.txt
- Deploy dashboard to Streamlit Cloud
- Share public URL and README with screenshots
